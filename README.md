## 📖 User Story

As a developer:
I want to transform a Google Books API search engine from a RESTful API to a GraphQL API using Apollo Server.
I want to ensure the authentication middleware works seamlessly with the new GraphQL setup.
I want to create an Apollo Provider for efficient communication with the Apollo Server.
I want to deploy the fully functional application to Render for users to access.

## 📝 Assignment Overview

Challenge Details:
Modern web applications thrive on data and user demands. To keep up with evolving user expectations, applications need to be performant and personalized. This challenge encapsulates these real-world web development principles.

You are provided with a fully functional Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API. The application is built using the MERN stack:

MongoDB database
Express.js server
React front end
Node.js backend
Your goal is to refactor this application to use GraphQL with Apollo Server. The app already supports saving book searches to the back end.

## 🛠 Steps to Complete the Challenge:
Set Up Apollo Server:

Replace the existing RESTful API with GraphQL.
Implement queries and mutations to fetch and modify data.
Modify Authentication Middleware:

Ensure the existing authentication mechanism works within the GraphQL context.
Create Apollo Provider:

Set up the front end to communicate efficiently with the Apollo Server.
Deploy the Application:

Deploy the application to Render to make it accessible to users.

## 🌐 Deployment

Render Deployment Steps:
Ensure your codebase is ready for deployment.
Follow Render's deployment guide to set up your application.
Verify the deployed application works as expected.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
React for the front end
MongoDB for the database
Node.js and Express.js for the server
Apollo Server for GraphQL API

## 📢 Tips and Tricks:

GraphQL Queries and Mutations: Ensure you understand how to define and use them effectively.

Apollo Client Setup: Proper setup of Apollo Client is crucial for seamless communication with the server.
Authentication in GraphQL: Be mindful of how authentication flows differ between REST and GraphQL.

Deployment: Test your application locally before deploying to Render.
